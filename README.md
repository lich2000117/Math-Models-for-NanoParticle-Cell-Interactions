# Math Models for NanoParticle-Cell-Interactions (Liver Model)
 Mathematical models of nanoparticle-cell interactions Nanoparticles are a promising tool for the targeted delivery of medicine. However, the complex biological and physical processes that influence nanoparticle-cell interactions are not well understood. This project will develop mathematical models of nanoparticle transport (differential equations) and cell behaviour (differential equations or agent-based models). These models will help us understand which biological and physical processes dictate whether the targeted delivery of medicine via nanoparticles will be successful.
